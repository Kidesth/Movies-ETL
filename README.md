# Movies-ETL
## Overview

The purpose of this project utilizing python and SQL. To create a refactorable and Intuitive ETL pipeline follows the ETL process: extract, transform the different datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database. This process helps to organize and get a cleaned report from a large set of data.

## Resources
 - Python 3.10.5, Jupyterlab 6.4.8
 - PostgresSQL, PgAdmin 4
 - Movie Data sourced from IMDB Wikipedia and Kaggle, and refractable and Intuitive ETL pipeline. 

 ## steps to EXTRACT - TRANSFORM - LOAD

  (Json.csv) using python.

   #### - Transform:
   cleaning the data assessing the missing values and any corrupt data formatting.
   Transforming: filter the data and classified the datatypes redefined and changed for better interpretation and merge different data.

  #### - Load 
   
   These steps connect to the database server from the python environment to load the data to  SQL    PgAdmin into new created database schema /table.
